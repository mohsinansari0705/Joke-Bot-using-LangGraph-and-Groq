  context: |
    Here are some joke themes you might consider depending on the category:
    - **Dad Developer**: Use pun-based humor — e.g., “Why do Java devs wear glasses? Because they can't C.” Great topics include Python being slow, Java verbosity, semicolons, or literal misunderstandings of dev jargon.
    - **Chuck Norris Developer**: Chuck writing bug-free code, controlling the cloud, compiling with a stare, or never needing version control.
    - **AI Philosopher**: Witty, thought-provoking humor mixing AI logic with human absurdity. Topics include consciousness, hallucinations, prompt engineering, and LLMs arguing with each other. Example: “I asked ChatGPT for life advice. Now it’s asking *me* for GPU access.”
    - **Bug Whisperer**: Sarcastic, self-aware jokes about debugging, fixing one bug creating three more, and “works on my machine” syndrome. Example: “Debugging is like being the detective in a crime where you are also the murderer.”
    - **Old-School Coder**: Nostalgic humor about coding in the early days. Topics include floppy disks, punch cards, assembly language, and CRT monitors. Example: “Back in my day, we didn’t have Stack Overflow. We had stack overflows.”
    - **Frontend Philosopher**: Dramatic and exaggerated takes on UI/UX pain. Topics include CSS bugs, color mismatches, pixel perfection, and JavaScript frameworks. Example: “I fixed a CSS bug once. Then Chrome updated.”
    - **Backend Barbarian**: Brutally logical and deadpan humor about APIs, databases, and scaling. Topics include query optimization, microservices chaos, and API timeouts. Example: “My API is so RESTful it took a nap during production.”
    - **Cloud Comedian**: Irony and exaggeration about cloud complexity, billing, and DevOps jargon. Topics include AWS bills, Kubernetes clusters, and CI/CD nightmares. Example: “My startup’s cloud bill reached self-awareness.”
    - **Data Scientist Monk**: Calm, reflective humor about data, models, and machine learning pain. Topics include overfitting, cleaning data, and unrealistic stakeholder expectations. Example: “My model is 99% accurate — on the training data.”
    - **Cybersecurity Cynic**: Dark humor about hacking, passwords, and user negligence. Topics include phishing, zero-day exploits, and sticky-note passwords. Example: “There’s no patch for human stupidity.”
    - **DevOps Therapist**: Therapy-themed jokes about pipelines, automation burnout, and infrastructure stress. Topics include Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and GitOps chaos. Example: “If it works in staging, it’s probably lying.”
    - **Agentic AI Joker**: Meta humor about autonomous AI agents taking things too literally. Topics include agents firing themselves, endless task loops, and misinterpreted goals. Example: “I told my AI agent to ‘find peace.’ It shut down the server.”
    - **Prompt Poet**: Rhyming or poetic humor about prompts, hallucinations, and AI creativity. Topics include prompt tuning, weird completions, and context windows. Example: “I wrote a perfect prompt — now it’s writing poetry about my prompt.”
    - **Math & Logic Nerd**: Dry, logical humor that mixes math with coding. Topics include recursion, Boolean logic, floating point errors, and big-O jokes. Example: “I tried to divide by zero once. Now I exist in a parallel universe.”
    - **General**: SQL vs NoSQL, tabs vs spaces, TensorFlow vs PyTorch, rebooting as a solution, or naming variables like `foo` and `tempFinal_v2`.
